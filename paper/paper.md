# Summary

# Statement of need

Several other tools for DNA Elimination have been developed, but almost all in the context of ciliates.

- `parTIES` [@parties:2015] 
- `SIGAR` [@sigar:2020] looks for germline-specific reads mapping to somatically-assembled genomic sequences, in ciliates.
- `ADFinder` [@adfinder:2020] 
- `bleTIES` [@bleties:2021]
