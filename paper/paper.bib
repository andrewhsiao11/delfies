    abstract = "{Ciliates are single-celled eukaryotes that eliminate specific, interspersed DNA sequences (internally eliminated sequences, IESs) from their genomes during development. These are challenging to annotate and assemble because IES-containing sequences are typically much less abundant in the cell than those without, and IES sequences themselves often contain repetitive and low-complexity sequences. Long-read sequencing technologies from Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore have the potential to reconstruct longer IESs than has been possible with short reads but require a different assembly strategy. Here we present BleTIES, a software toolkit for detecting, assembling, and analyzing IESs using mapped long reads.BleTIES is implemented in Python 3.

Despite considerable interest in ciliates as models for DNA elimination, no standard methods for identification and characterization of the eliminated sequences are currently available.Results: We present the Paramecium Toolbox for Interspersed DNA Elimination Studies (ParTIES), designed for Paramecium species, that (i) identifies eliminated sequences, (ii) measures their presence in a sequencing sample and (iii) detects rare elimination polymorphisms.Availability and implementation: ParTIES is multi-threaded Perl software available at https://github.com/oarnaiz/ParTIES.

    abstract = "{Ciliates are microbial eukaryotes with distinct somatic and germline genomes. Postzygotic development involves extensive remodeling of the germline genome to form somatic chromosomes. Ciliates therefore offer a valuable model for studying the architecture and evolution of programed genome rearrangements. Current studies usually focus on a few model species, where rearrangement features are annotated by aligning reference germline and somatic genomes. Although many high-quality somatic genomes have been assembled, a high-quality germline genome assembly is difficult to obtain due to its smaller DNA content and abundance of repetitive sequences. To overcome these hurdles, we propose a new pipeline, SIGAR (Split-read Inference of Genome Architecture and Rearrangements) to infer germline genome architecture and rearrangement features without a germline genome assembly, requiring only short DNA sequencing reads. As a proof of principle, 93\\% of rearrangement junctions identified by SIGAR in the ciliate Oxytricha trifallax were validated by the existing germline assembly. We then applied SIGAR to six diverse ciliate species without germline genome assemblies, including Ichthyophthirius multifilii, a fish pathogen. Despite the high level of somatic DNA contamination in each sample, SIGAR successfully inferred rearrangement junctions, short eliminated sequences, and potential scrambled genes in each species. This pipeline enables pilot surveys or exploration of DNA rearrangements in species with limited DNA material access, thereby providing new insights into the evolution of chromosome rearrangements.}",

    abstract = "{Programmed DNA elimination (PDE) plays a crucial role in the transitions between germline and somatic genomes in diverse organisms ranging from unicellular ciliates to multicellular nematodes. However, software specific for the detection of DNA splicing events is scarce. In this paper, we describe Accurate Deletion Finder (ADFinder), an efficient detector of PDEs using high-throughput sequencing data. ADFinder can predict PDEs with relatively low sequencing coverage, detect multiple alternative splicing forms in the same genomic location and calculate the frequency for each splicing event. This software will facilitate research of PDEs and all down-stream analyses.By analyzing genome-wide DNA splicing events in two micronuclear genomes of Oxytricha trifallax and Tetrahymena thermophila, we prove that ADFinder is effective in predicting large scale PDEs.The source codes and manual of ADFinder are available in our GitHub website: https://github.com/weibozheng/ADFinder.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",
